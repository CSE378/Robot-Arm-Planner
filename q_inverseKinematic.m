function [theta1, theta2] = q_inverseKinematic(robotEnv, desiredHandTipXY)
% Implement this function
% Inputs:
%   robotEnv: two-link arm environment, created using robotEnv = M_TwoLinkArm(obstacles).
%   desiredHandTipXY: a 2*1 vector for the desired X and Y positions of the tip of the robot's arm.
% Output:
%   theta1: the angle of the first joint
%   theta2: the angle of the second joint
%   If there is no feasible solution, theta1 and theta2 are []


% Dummy code, feel free to change
theta1 = pi/2;
theta2 = -pi/2;
